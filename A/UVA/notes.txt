UVA should use Main word with the class
and remove all spaces and all comments
if the number has integer root that means number of its factor is odd
ex 
8 
1 8
2 4 
1 2 4 8 even as root(8) not int
9 
1 9 
3 3
1 3 9 odd as root(9) = 3 

the problems that has very big integer values 
two ways
1 using BigInteger class
2 using array of the number which is to make the number reversed(multiplication by hand)
 75
423
------
15  21  14  28
   +10 +20
15  31  34  28
5   2   7    1  3
the result is 52713 
the numbers result from multiplication
in the position i + j then you can keep the digit and move the carry one digit
